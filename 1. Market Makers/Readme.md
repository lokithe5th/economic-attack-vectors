## Market Makers  

A sale is when one asset is swapped for another asset. We swap our time (labour) for money. We swap our money for shares. And sometimes we swap the right to these shares for the privilige of borrowing other assets.  

Swapping assets which are limited in number (i.e. scarce), and the study of the extensions and variations upon this idea, is micro-economics.  

To swap things we need a willing seller and a willing buyer. With this a market is made. 

Markets follow supply and demand. If the supply of an asset is low, and there are many buyers, then the buyers need to compete for the asset by offering a better price to the sellers. The opposite happens with an asset that is available in too great a quantity. The sellers now need to compete by accepting a lower price to buyers.

Price discovery happens as the prices being offered and accepted converge. Given a fixed supply and a fixed demand the price will at some point in time become more balanced. We know that supply and demand is not fixed. And so price varies as the market receives more information and reacts to that information (for example XRP before and after July 2023).
