## Order books  
Markets is where buyers and sellers meet. In TradFi we use order books to match the buyers with sellers.

A buyer will open an order for 100 asset X in exchange for 10 asset Y. The seller can only sell if there is someone else taking the buy side. The buyer can only purchase asset Y if there is someone else who wants to sell it at that price.  

Order books are also used in centralized exchanges (CEXes), both in TradFi and DeFi.  

Depending on the asset, orders can take some time to fill. They may also fail. 

As the market is not static, a price may move in either party's favor. 

> Swapping is a zero-sum game, and so, if one party is favored the other party is at a disadvantage. This is fundamental to all markets.
