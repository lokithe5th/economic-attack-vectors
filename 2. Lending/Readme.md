## 2. Lending  

Lending is as integral to DeFi as it is to TradFi.  

The motivation in DeFi is much the same as in TradFi. Users supply assets into a protocol, and other users are charged interest, or fees, to borrow these assets.  

Lending can be decentralized because users have to provide more collateral than they borrow.  

How can this be useful to a user? By depositing assets into a protocol the depositor is able to maintain exposure to that asset, while still being able to borrow a less volatile asset to conduct business in.  

The concept of leverage is fundamental to finance, and this is one of the primitives required for this to function.
