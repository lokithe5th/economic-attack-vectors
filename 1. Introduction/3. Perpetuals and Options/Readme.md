## Perpetuals and Options  

Perpetuals and options are financial derivatives commonplace in TradFi.

An Option is a contract which gives the buyer the ability, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a specified amount, of a specified asset, at an agreed upon price at a fixed time in the future (expiry or settlement date). 

A perpetual, in contrast, does not have an expiry or settlement date.  

Options and perpetuals allow: 
- hedging: reducing risk by guarding against unanticipated market movements  
- speculation: making a bet that price will move in a certain direction  

> Beware: options and Perpetuals magnify market movements.  

In terms of fundementals, we will provide an overview of perpetuals and options in this section.
