## Perpetuals and Options  

These are financial derivative contracts.  

An option is an agreement that allows a user to purchase or sell an asset for a predetermined price, in a set amount, at an agreed upon date.  

There are two types of these agreements: put options and call options.

### Puts  

A put option agreement allows a user to sell an asset for an agreed upon price, in a set amount on a certain deadline.

### Call  

A call option agreement allows a user to buy an asset at a certain price and at such amounts that have been agreed upon beforehand. 

### Moneyness  

An option is *in the money* (ITM) when the option holder can exercise the option for profit. When exercising an option will lead to losses for the holder, it is deemed *out of the money* (OTM).  

The price where an asset crosses from ITM to OTM, or vice versa, is called the strike price. If the market price equals the strike price, the option is *at the money* (ATM).

> A perpetual is the same agreement, but without an expiry date.  

Of course, it's a little more complicated than that. Let's dive in!
