## Incentives  

Automated market makers incentivize users to provide liquidity by awarding them the fees proportional to their contribution to the underlying pool.  

These liquidity providers make sure that there is always a market for the swaps to occur.  

If liquidity is shallow (meaning the token reserves are low), then prices will shift more during trades. Pools incentivize liquidity provisioning by offering other rewards (boosts). The incentive is thus the additional funds earned from swaps and boosts. 

### Uniswap V3  

If an asset trades within a specific range, for example ETH @ 1500 - 1900 USDC, then most of the liquidity is unused (the price moves along the hyperbola as the reserves shift, but the vast majority of the price points on the curve is never reached, wasting liquidity).  

V3 addresses this by allowing users to provide liquidity in specific ranges: instead of supplying unspecified liquidity in a pool, a user is able to allocate the assets they supply to the pool to provide liquidity within specific ranges.  

Now the user is able to specify that the provided liquidity should only be used within a custom price range. Once the asset price leaves that range, then the user no longer earns fees for swaps that occur.  

This serves to better incentivize liquidity providers and deepen liquidity for less slippage.
