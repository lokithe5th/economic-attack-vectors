## Thoughts for security researchers  
From a security perspective we see that such a design allows certain actions:  

**If the reserves of a smart contract can be added to assymmetrically, the price will change.**  

This is intended, as swaps in one direction is not separate from large deposits in one direction. In both cases the reserves of an asset are altered and the price will move in favor of buyers for the asset being supplied and vice versa (see the above on supply and demand).  

From experience, after spending many hours of bug hunting trying to trick AMMs into giving better prices the following holds true:  
1. In most cases, it's rarely a valid issue if the reserves/price can be manipulated by a user. The attacker needs to spend resources to accomplish the manipulation, and the implementation of the AMMs serve to limit the benefit from this. In most cases they will lose assets, even if they can manipulate the price. If you can prove the contrary, you most likely have a valid vulnerability.
2. Vulnerabilities can arise when the price in the AMM is used in other places in the protocol. Always identify which new code *assumes* an unmanipulated price.
3. Custom logic in `routers` and `pair` contracts often hide vulnerabilities.
