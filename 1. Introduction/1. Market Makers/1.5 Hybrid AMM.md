## Hybrid Models  
Curve uses a hybrid model. We know, of course, that it's undesirable to have a liquidity pool completely drained. On the other hand, it is also undesirable for swap pricing to move with every swap, especially if there assets are expected to be 1:1 in value.  

> Please note my explanation is greatly simplified here.

Curve combines these two approaches to create an AMM which uses the arithmetic and geometric means to derive a price which is less prone to slippage within certain parameters but with enough price movement when approaching the hyperbola limits that it is not efficient to drain the pool.  

The math here can become intimidating. [The Curve (StableSwap) whitepaper is the best place to start](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/files/stableswap-paper.pdf/)
